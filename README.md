# 🎧 Adi Music
Your Music
forked from **snae player**

Adi Music is a tiny, cozy music player that lives entirely in your browser.
No installs, no uploads, no cloud nonsense. Just you, your local files, and vibes.

It’s built to be fast, simple, and respectful of your device.
Dark mode, light mode, smooth animations, and UI colors that adapt to your album art included ✨

## 🌈 Features

* Plays your local audio files directly in the browser
* Fully on-device. Your music never leaves your machine
* Dark & Light themes
* Artwork-based dynamic UI coloring
* Smooth, playful animations
* Lightweight and fast
* Open source and hackable

---

## ⚠️ A Note on Browser Support

Adi Music uses the **File System Access API**, a newer web API that lets websites access files *only* when you allow it.

* Works best on **Chromium-based browsers** (Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc.)
* Other browsers fall back to the legacy Files API
* In fallback mode, files are copied into IndexedDB, which may use extra storage

This keeps the app usable everywhere, even if the experience isn’t identical.

## 🌍 Works With

All modern browsers.
Best experience on Chromium-based ones.

## 🔐 Privacy 

Adi Music uses minimal, privacy-friendly analytics to count page views.
No tracking, no ads, no creepy stuff. *yuck tbh*
